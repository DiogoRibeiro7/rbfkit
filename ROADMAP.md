### Jacobian / Gradient & Hessian

Provide methods to compute ∇ₓ φ(x) and even ∇²ₓ φ(x) so users can get derivatives of the interpolant (useful in optimization or PDE collocation).

### Scikit-Learn API Compatibility

Subclass `BaseEstimator` and `RegressorMixin` so your interpolator works with `Pipeline`, `GridSearchCV`, etc.

### Automatic ε Selection Helpers

Beyond leave-one-out, add grid-search wrappers or L-curve heuristics, and plot tools to visualize CV error vs ε.

### Localized / Partition-of-Unity RBF

Split large data into overlapping patches, fit local RBFs and blend them—boosts speed and limits blurring over large domains.

### Low-Rank & Fast Methods

- **Nyström** or **random Fourier features** for approximate kernels.  
- **Fast multipole** or tree-based algorithms to accelerate evaluation on big datasets.

### Support for Custom Distance Metrics

Plug in Mahalanobis or other user-supplied distance functions for non-Euclidean domains.

### GPU / Parallel Backends

Optionally dispatch heavy matrix solves or kernel builds to CuPy, PyTorch, or to multi-core NumPy (via Dask) for large-scale problems.

### Multivariate / Vector-Valued Outputs

Let values be ℝᵐ so you can interpolate vector fields in one go, with a single solve per output dimension.

### Visualization Utilities

- 1D/2D slice plots of basis functions.  
- Surface plots of the interpolant over a grid.  
- Error heatmaps comparing truth vs RBF prediction.

### Serialization & Persistence

Implement `to_dict` / `from_dict` or use `joblib` hooks so users can save and load fitted interpolators easily.

### Batch & Streaming Prediction

Provide `predict_batch` that chunks very large `x_new` to cap memory usage, or even an online-update API for streaming data.

### PDE-Collocation & Moment Fitting

Higher-level wrappers for common PDE boundary-value problems, building the collocation matrix automatically from differential operators.
